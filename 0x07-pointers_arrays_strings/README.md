### 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings  
> Learning more about pointers, arrays and strings and how to use them both individually and interractively to produce programs that run effectively.

##### General Learning Objectives  

> -What are pointers to pointers and how to use them  
> -What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them  
> -What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings  

##### Mandatory Tasks  

There are **eight** of them which include;  
> 0. Writing a function that fills memory with a constant byte.  
> 1. Writing a function that copies memory area.  
> 2. Writing a function that locates a character in a string.  
> 3. Writing a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.  
> 4. Writing a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.  
> 5. Writing a function that locates a substring.  
> 6. Writing a function that prints the chessboard.  
> 7. Writing a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
